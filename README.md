# Profile Links
A profile with links, built on React with the base of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo, set the project up with the following commands.

Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

Run project (Should run by default on: http://localhost:3005/):
```sh
yarn start
```

Run mock APIs (Should run by default on: http://localhost:3000/):

This needs to be run in a separate terminal, as the application displays data from the API.
```sh
yarn start-json
```

Run tests:
```sh
yarn test
```
